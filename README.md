# Comparer_Python
Add-In that lets the user save a snapshot of the current model then compare it to a later state - written in Python.
The Add-In's idea comes from this idea station post: [Quick difference view between before and after an edit](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-ideastation-request-a/quick-difference-view-between-before-and-after-an-edit/idi-p/5556293)

## Usage
The Add-In provides a single command added to the "Model" workspace's "Inspect" panel, but it has two states:
- "Save Snapshot": this saves a snapshot of the current view
- "Compare To Snapshot": this also saves a snapshot of the current view, but as a different image and then shows the newly created image and the one previously created by the "Save Snapshot" command inside a webpage where the user can easily swap between the snapshot of the two states and compare them visually
