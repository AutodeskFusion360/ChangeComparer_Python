# Comparer_Python
AddIn that lets the user save a snapshot of the current model then compare it to a later state - written in Python

# Usage
The Add-In provides two commands that are added to the "Model" workspace's "Inspect" panel:
- "Comparer Save": this saves a snapshot of the current view
- "Comparer View": this also saves a snapshot of the current view, but as a different image and then shows the newly created image and the one previously created by the "Comparer Save" command inside a webpage where the user can easily swap between the snapshot of the two states and compare them visually
